# Clock-App-JS
Building a clock with JavaScript

This project is based off a Youtube tutorial which shows you how to code a functioning clock app. 
The app predominantly used JavaScript for its forking parts like the hands (seconds, minutes, hour hands).
Additionally, the clock requires styling in a way that allows the numbers to be displayed
in a circular rotation about a circle which is designed in html and CSS.
